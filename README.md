# Description
The technology of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has been gaining popularity recently. To deepen my understanding of this field, I decided to create a simple desktop application for RAG using Notion as a dataset. Notion is a tool I frequently use for taking notes and studying, making it the perfect choice for this project. <br>
Additionally, I set a restriction on not spending any money during the app development process
